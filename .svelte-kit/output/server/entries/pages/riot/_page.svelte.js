The goal is to have a more digestable way of interacting with these texts, seeing and hearing a summary of these works within a short period of time.</p> <p><strong>My role:</strong> I developed the entirety of this system, writing python scripts for preprocessing and javascript for the music and graphics</p> <p><strong>Brief intro to your audience:</strong> This project was put on public display at Harvard&#39;s Science and Engineering Complex for a conference on Data Visualization. The goal was to create innovative ways of visualizing big data.</p> <p><strong>Your approach to the problem space:</strong> This project went through multiple stages of consumer testing, where the audience had to rate how well they were understanding the data being presented to them. This allowed for an iterative design where processing, graphics, and music were changed multiple times. For example, the graphics started out much simpler and didn&#39;t really paint an image of what was going on in the text, but this design element was improved upon after feedback.</p> <p><strong>Constraints or obstacles:</strong> A major constraint was working with the pre-existing sentiment analysis methods to get accurate results. Much testing was done to figure out whether the percentage of emotions represented on the screen accurately corresponded to the underlying themes of the plot or philosophy.</p> <p><strong>Reflections:</strong> In hindsight, I could&#39;ve come up with a more quantitative way to display the sentiment analysis data, but the final product was well-received and represents a unique collaboration between technology and art</p></div></section> <section class="container svelte-71ls6o"><div class="text-section svelte-71ls6o"><p>This is the first iteration of the application.
